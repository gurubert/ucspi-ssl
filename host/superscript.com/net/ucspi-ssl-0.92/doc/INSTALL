Installation supplements
------------------------

Within the ./src directory you find some conf-* files for your adjustments:

1. Compilation      
- conf-cc (don't need to be touched)
- conf-ld (remove option '-m64' and/or replace it with your architecure; ie. installing on x86 needs removing this flag)
- conf-ccperl (no adjustments required) 
- conf-ldperl (no adjustments required)

2. Installation
- conf-tcpbin (path to the ucspi-tcp commands; usually /usr/local/bin)
- conf-perl (no adjustments required)
- conf-ssl (default; add path to additional openssl libraries; e.g. Kerberos)
- man/conf-man (man page target) => /usr/share/man

3. Certificate and key file handling -- these are parms declared for each server; thus may stay empty/untouched.
   Default values MAY be provided as:
- conf-cafile
- conf-ccafile
- conf-certchainfile
- conf-certfile
- conf-ciphers
- conf-dhfile
- conf-keyfile
- conf-rsa (length of RSA cipher; 1024 bit)

4. Installation procedure
   Usually, you just install the package with

- package/install

or -- in case the Perl install failes --

- package/install base
- package/man

5. Testing
- package/rts -- or  --
- package/rts base (if Perl is not installed/working).

  The etc/ directory includes some X.509 certs and keyfiles
  for testing. Have a look at those !

6. ucspi-tcp dependencies 
   The vanilla ucspi-tcp-0.88 package from Dan Bernstein does not support
   building 'tcprules' with CIDR support. 

   Download and install 'ucspi-tcp6' from 
   http://www.fehcom.de/ipnet/ucpsi-tcp6.html.
